Library Dependencies:

To install the libraries, go to the libraries manager in the Arduino IDE
searh DHT11 - install the first one by Adafruit
search OneWire - install the one whose title is just "OneWire"
search DallasTemperature - install the one whose title is just "DallasTemperature"
search NewPing - install the one whose title is just "NewPing"
LiquidCrystal - fmalpartida New LiquidCrystal  - from bitbucket - this library is also in the Github folder.
Download the Adafruit_Sensor library from here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
	Unzip it and put it in the libraries folder inside the Arduino folder in Documents.
